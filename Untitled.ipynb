    "## 1. Input Video:-\n",
    "    * Image Processing via OpenCV\n",
    "    * video converted to BAtch of Frames Which are down Sampled to 320x180\n",
    "    * the color images are converted in to grey scale images to reduce the processing power, for high speed processing.\n",
    "## 2. Feature Detection (face mouth and eye blink):- \n",
    "    *The driver fatigue and eye rub detection is carried out in several stages, \n",
    "        * first we find out the Haar like features (are digital image features used in object recognition  using  similar       techniques Like  Haar wavelets and were used in the first real-time face detector. Adaboost  algorithm is used  along with haar like features to get real time face detection.\n",
    "        * ADAPTIVE TEMPLATE MATCHING  is used for detecting close eyes even when face is tilted.\n",
    "        * we will use to detect percentage change  of black pixels  in eyes to detect the eye closing . also we will check out Percentage of Eye Closure (PERCLOS=Number of times eye blinked / (30 * sampling rate) ) and will alert user when it remains more than 30% of time during 30 second time frame.\n",
    "        * similarly We can find eye rub detection By finding wether the  sum of the black pixels in the left eye is lesser than the sum of the black pixels in the right eye or vice versa.\n",
    "## 3. Driver Alert\n",
    "    * using  text to speech libraries  to alert the person."
